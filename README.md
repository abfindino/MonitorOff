The Monitor Off Utility is a lightweight Windows 10 application that allows you to instantly turn off your monitor with a single click. Unlike the standard power-saving sleep mode, this app forces the display to shut down immediately while keeping your PC running in the background.

Key Features:

- One-Click Monitor Off – Run the app, and your screen turns off instantly.
- No Background Processes – The app exits after execution, leaving no unnecessary tasks running.
- Wake-Up Normally – Simply move your mouse or press any key to turn the monitor back on, just like regular Windows behavior.
- Energy Saving – Reduce power consumption when you step away from your PC without putting the system to sleep.
- Portable & Lightweight – No installation needed; just run the executable whenever needed.

How It Works:

- Run the app (or pin it to the Start Menu for quick access).
- Monitor turns off immediately—ideal for saving power or privacy.
- Wake it up by moving the mouse or pressing a key—your display reactivates instantly.
- Perfect for users who want quick manual control over their monitor’s power state without waiting for sleep timers.
