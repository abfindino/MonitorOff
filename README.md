The Monitor Off Utility is a lightweight Windows 10 application that allows you to instantly turn off your monitor with a single click. Unlike the standard power-saving sleep mode, this app forces the display to shut down immediately while keeping your PC running in the background.

Key Features:

- One-Click Monitor Off – Run the app, and your screen turns off instantly.
- No Background Processes – The app exits after execution, leaving no unnecessary tasks running.
- Wake-Up Normally – Simply move your mouse or press any key to turn the monitor back on, just like regular Windows behavior.
- Energy Saving – Reduce power consumption when you step away from your PC without putting the system to sleep.
- Portable & Lightweight – No installation needed; just run the executable whenever needed.

How It Works:

- Run the app (or pin it to the Start Menu for quick access).
- Monitor turns off immediately—ideal for saving power or privacy.
- Wake it up by moving the mouse or pressing a key—your display reactivates instantly.
- Perfect for users who want quick manual control over their monitor’s power state without waiting for sleep timers.

*** Windows/Browser Blocking Notice & How to Fix It ***

Modern browsers and Windows Defender often flag .exe files as potentially harmful, even when they are 100% safe — like this one. This is a false positive caused by the fact that:
- The file is not widely known or digitally signed.
- It's a new file without a history or publisher identity.

To avoid this issue, I’ve provided a ZIP version of the .exe file. You can download the ZIP with no issues and then extract it safely on your computer.

How to Stop Windows Defender from Deleting the File?

If Windows Defender removes the .exe file after extraction, follow these steps to add it as an exception:
-Press Windows Key and type Windows Security, then open it.
-Go to “Virus & threat protection”.
-Scroll down and click “Manage settings” under Virus & threat protection settings.
-Scroll down and click “Add or remove exclusions” under Exclusions.
-Click “+ Add an exclusion” → choose “File”.
-Browse and select the .exe file you extracted from the ZIP.
-Once added, Windows Defender will no longer flag or delete the file.

Is it safe?
-Yes! This is a tool I created myself. It’s not harmful, it just lacks a verified signature because I’m an independent developer sharing it freely. If you have any concerns, feel free to run the file through VirusTotal.com for extra peace of mind.
